# migrations

Files in this folder MUST be in Linux format (CR), NOT Windows format (CRLF),   
because they are created with sqlx _migrate_ command in a bash shell.  
When cloned from the repo they are (possibly) in Windows format (CRLF).  
Use this comamnd from the root folder:
```sh
find migrations -name "*.sql" -exec dos2unix {} \;
```

Explanation:  
- find migrations: Start searching in the migrations directory (from current location)
- -name "*.sql": Look for files with .sql extension
- -exec dos2unix {} \;: For each file found, run dos2unix on it
- {} is replaced with the filename found
- \; marks the end of the -exec command
